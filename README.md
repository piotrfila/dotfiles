### NixOS configuration for all my systems

Hello!

This reposiory contains the nixos configuration for my laptop and desktop.
I might also migrate my rpi 4 and zero to using nix in the future.
Some cool features include:
- impersistence
- GPU and USB passthrough to a windows VM
- local AI with ollama
- most dotfiles are configured with homemanager
- gtk apps have dark theme (seriously why is this complicated?)
