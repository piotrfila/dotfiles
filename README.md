### NixOS configuration for all my systems

Hello!

This reposiory contains the nixos configuration for my laptop, desktop and
a raspberry pi 4 running mainsail/moonraker/klipper for controlling a 3D printer.
More hosts are coming as I continue to nixify every machine I have.
Some cool features include:
- impersistence
- GPU and USB passthrough to a windows VM
- local AI with ollama
- most dotfiles are configured with homemanager
- gtk apps have dark theme (seriously why is this complicated?)
