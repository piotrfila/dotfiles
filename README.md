### NixOS configuration for all my systems

Hello!

This reposiory contains the nixos configuration for my laptop, desktop and a raspberry pi 4.
More hosts are coming as I continue to nixify every machine I have.
Some cool features include:
- impersistence
- GPU and USB passthrough to a windows VM
- local AI with ollama
- 3D printer control with mainsail/moonraker/klipper (includes some nixpkgs fixes that I should open a PR for at some point)
- DNS ad blocking with adguard
- most dotfiles are configured with homemanager
- gtk apps have dark theme (seriously why is this complicated?)
